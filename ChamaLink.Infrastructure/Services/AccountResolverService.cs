// IMPORTANT: This is the ONLY place in the whole app that should decide
// what a LedgerEntry.AccountId is.
//
// Before this fix, different parts of the code used three different
// (wrong) values as "AccountId":
//   1. GroupMember.Id was used directly (EventService, background job).
//   2. "The first Account row in the whole database" was used
//      (MkobaImportController, ReportsController) - this mixed up
//      money between different members and different groups.
//   3. A raw AccountId sent by the client, with no checks (WelfareController).
//
// Because of that, entries written by different modules could not be
// found by GetMemberStatementAsync, which only looks at REAL Account IDs
// that belong to that specific member. So imported transactions, welfare
// deductions and fines were invisible on a member's statement.
//
// From now on, every service must call GetOrCreateAccountAsync() below to
// get a real, member-specific Account before writing a LedgerEntry.

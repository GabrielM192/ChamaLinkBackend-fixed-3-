// ONE ComplianceSnapshot row per (GroupMember, Month) - a pure reporting
// layer over what Phase 2 (Member Status Engine) and Phase 3 (Fine Engine
// + ARCH-001 debt allocation) have already decided. This service never
// changes Status, never creates a Debt or Fine, never moves money - it
// only reads what those two phases already produced and records it, so
// Reports/Dashboard (Phase 5) can query one table instead of re-scanning
// LedgerEntries/Debts/Fines every time.
